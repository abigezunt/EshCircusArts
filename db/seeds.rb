	bio: "Tracy McAskill began studying contortion at the age of 16. She credits her introduction to contortion to her extensive dance background. Taking her first ballet class at the age of 6, she quickly excelled and began competing in dance competitions in her early teens. This competitive environment inspired Tracy to begin her own personal conditioning regime, where stretching gradually turned into contortion. Tracy began seriously training as a contortionist in 2008. She takes a very methodical and safety-conscious approach to her training and specializes in extreme back flexibility and oversplits.",
